	Error Logic Archive
</h1>
<p>
	This is a secret archive of pages from all around the internet. All of these sites <br> are currently blocked by some school firewalls. You used to have to use the <br> Wayback Machine, but that got blocked too. That is why I created this tool. <br> Some of the games require Flash so make sure you have it turned on. Have fun!
